# Epileptic-Seizure-Detection
This repository consists of medical data chosen with the intention to classify people on
whether they have Epilepsy or not using both Supervised and Unsupervised techniques.
These kind of analyses can be extrapolated and can be used to predict Epilepsy while
itâ€™s still early, for medical intervention. 
The best technique is the one with the highest value of TP (True Positive).
